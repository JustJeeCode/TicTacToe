# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game in python.

The game is run in the output, to mark a cell just put in an x and a y coordinate. E.g. (X: 2, Y: 3).

If you are running a Windows machine please change the variable clear = os.system('clear') to clear = os.system('cls')
otherwise the code will bug.

Thanks and enjoy!
